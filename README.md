# Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll
## Overview

Welcome to the Python Data Analysis Challenge! This project is an opportunity to showcase your proficiency in Python programming, particularly in the domain of data analysis and manipulation. In this challenge, you will tackle two distinct tasks: PyBank and PyPoll. Each task involves processing CSV files, performing computations, and presenting insightful reports.

## Task 1: PyBank - Financial Analysis

PyBank requires you to analyze financial records to gain insights into the performance of a company. The dataset, `budget_data.csv`, provides information in two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". Your goal is to develop a Python script capable of calculating essential financial metrics:

- **Total Months:** Determine the total number of months included in the dataset.
- **Net Total:** Calculate the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- **Average Change:** Compute the average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- **Greatest Increase:** Identify the month with the greatest increase in profits, along with the corresponding amount.
- **Greatest Decrease:** Identify the month with the greatest decrease in profits, along with the corresponding amount.

The final analysis will be presented both in the terminal and exported to a text file named `financial_analysis.txt`.

## Task 2: PyPoll - Election Analysis

PyPoll focuses on modernizing the vote-counting process for a small town. The provided dataset, `election_data.csv`, contains columns for "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to develop a Python script to analyze the election data and produce various insights:

- **Total Votes:** Calculate the total number of votes cast in the election.
- **Candidates List:** Compile a list of candidates who received votes.
- **Vote Percentage:** Determine the percentage of votes each candidate won.
- **Winner Determination:** Identify the candidate with the highest number of votes and declare them the winner.

The election analysis results will be displayed in the terminal and saved to a text file named `election_results.txt`.

## Conclusion

The Python Data Analysis Challenge provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate your skills in Python programming and data analysis. By completing the PyBank and PyPoll tasks, you will showcase your ability to work with real-world datasets, perform calculations, and present meaningful insights. Best of luck with the challenge!
